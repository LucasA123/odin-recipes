    <img src="../images/sausage.jpeg">

    <h1>Description</h1> 

  <p>Searing sweet Italian sausage in a dry skillet renders the fat, resulting in a deliciously crispy sausage. Tender bell peppers add a welcome vegetal sweetness to this one-pan dinner while they cook down in a blend of savory chicken broth and tangy vinegar perfect for sopping up with crusty bread </p>

    <h1>Ingredients</h1> 

    <ul>

<li>4 (6- to 7-ounce) sweet Italian pork sausages</li>
<li>3 medium bell peppers (mix of yellow, red, and green), sliced (about 5 loosely packed cups)</li>
<li>1 large red onion, halved lengthwise and thinly sliced crosswise (about 3 cups)</li> 
<li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
<li>3 large garlic cloves, thinly sliced (about 11/2 tablespoons)</li>
<li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
<li>¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper</li>
<li>1 cup lower-sodium chicken broth</li>
<li>1 tablespoon red wine vinegar</li>
    
    </ul>

    <h1>Steps</h1> 

  <ol>

    <li>Preheat oven to 400°F. Prick Italian sausages all over using a knife. Place sausages in a cold large ovenproof skillet. Cook over medium-high, flipping occasionally, until browned on all sides, about 14 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Do not wipe skillet clean</li>

<li>Add bell peppers and onion to skillet; cook over medium-high, stirring often, until softened, about 6 minutes. Add tomato paste, garlic, salt, and crushed red pepper; cook, stirring often, until vegetables are well coated in tomato paste and garlic is tender and aromatic, about 2 minutes. Stir in broth and vinegar. Bring to a boil over medium-high. Boil, stirring often, until liquid has almost completely reduced, about 6 minutes. Return sausages to skillet</li>

<li>Transfer skillet to preheated oven, and roast until vegetables are tender and a thermometer inserted in thickest portion of sausages registers 160°F, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven; let stand until cool enough to handle, 3 to 5 minutes. Serve with crusty bread</li>
